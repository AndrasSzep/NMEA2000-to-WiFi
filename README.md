# NMEA2000-to-WiFi

This is an AI-assisted development of the simpliest device to display all essential data from NMEA2000 data bus
on your mobile devices - iPhone, Android, tablet, PC, whatever.

I use this low cost and simple M5Stack Atom lite kit with the CAN Bus adapter = $22.50

no soldering skills needed.

You can use the power directly from the NMEA bus by any DC-DC adapter
